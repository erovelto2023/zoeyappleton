Plan: Romance Author Website (built from The Billionaire’s Forbidden Desires Trilogy — tone, tropes & style)

Nice — I read your PDF and pulled the key tone, tropes, characters and beats. The trilogy leans into a gritty, high-stakes city backdrop, billionaire/enemies-to-lovers power dynamics, suspense (kidnapping/ransom), and intense, explicit chemistry — plus surprise-pregnancy / family / redemption arcs. Use those elements as the spine of the site.

The Billionaire's Forbidden Des…

Below is a detailed, ready-to-implement site plan that mirrors the book’s voice and converts curious readers into fans and buyers.

1) Brand & Visual Direction

Vibe: Urban-glamour + noir grit. Think polished skyscraper luxury (billionaire lifestyle) with shadowy alleys and neon—romance that’s dangerous and sensual. 

The Billionaire's Forbidden Des…

Palette: Midnight navy / charcoal, blood-rose accent, warm gold, soft cream for text blocks.

Typography: Dramatic serif for headings (Playfair/Cormorant), clean sans for body (Inter/Roboto).

Imagery: High-contrast photos of cityscapes, rain-slick streets, terraces overlooking lights, close but moody portraits (character moodboards). Avoid literal copyrighted covers — use original mockups.

Micro-interactions: Subtle parallax on hero image, smoky page transitions, rose-petal or spark particle divider for chapter teasers.

2) Sitemap & Priority Pages

Homepage (Hero spotlight + 1-click reading)

Books (Series hub) — book pages with buy links & excerpts

World & Timeline — Sterling City map, series timeline, crossover points

Meet the Characters — character cards (Zephyr, Harper, Olivia, Harper’s allies) with interactive reveals

Read Now / Free Library — lead-magnet bundle (first-chapter pack + spicy epilogue)

Behind the Scenes (Blog / Journal) — author voice, research, playlist, inspirations

Multimedia — book trailers, audiobook clips, YouTube embed (your channel)

Book Club / Reader Resources — discussion guides, printable kits, merch

Mailing List / VIP — gated exclusive scenes, preorder access

Contact / Press / Speaking

3) Homepage: wireframe + copy hooks (in-tone)

Wireframe: Full-bleed hero (city skyline at night), overlay headline, 3 CTAs: Read First Chapter — Join VIP — Watch Trailer. Under hero: rotating featured book carousel, “Meet Zephyr” microcard, social proof (reviews), & lead magnet strip.

Sample hero lines (original, in the trilogy tone):

He built empires with code. She built survival into a razor. In Sterling City, desire always has a price.
CTA buttons: Read Chapter One / Claim Your Free Epilogue / Watch the Trailer.
(These evoke the billionaire/edge-of-danger tone without quoting the book.)

4) Books Hub: each book page should include

Cover gallery (flat + 3D mockup), buy buttons (Amazon, Kobo, direct), and sample chapter inside a clean reader modal.

Tropes & heat meter (Enemies → Lovers ✓, Kidnapping/Suspense ✓, Billionaire Boss ✓, Surprise Pregnancy ✓). These help readers choose.

The Billionaire's Forbidden Des…

“Why you’ll fall” blurb (short pitch in series voice).

Scene spotlight — a short spoiler-free excerpt (under 25 words if quoting; otherwise paraphrase a tantalizing beat).

Extras: character playlists, wallpapers, PDF discussion kit.

5) Meet the Characters (interactive)

Front: card with moody portrait, tagline (e.g., “Zephyr — empire, ice, danger”)

Flip/hover: reveal personal secret, favorite line (paraphrase), what breaks them, and “their moral grey.”

Add a “chemistry meter” between any two characters (for fans who love ships). This leans on the trilogy’s charged dynamics.

6) World & Timeline (reader immersion)

Sterling City map — click districts (downtown, entertainment, gallery, Zephyr’s tower) with short scenes/mini-flashback blurbs anchored to place. This leverages the city as character.

Series timeline — show overlap between books, who appears where, and recommended read order.

7) Lead Magnets & Funnels

Book countdown / pre-order widget for upcoming releases.

Commented Scene — readers can highlight and comment on choose scenes (community engagement).

Dynamic CTA: show “Read Now” vs “Preorder” depending on user’s sign-in and previous downloads.

9) Blog & Content Calendar (60-90 days starter)

Post types (weekly cadence):

Also publish: Book club kits & “Write like Zoey” mini-guides. (Use blog to funnel to free library and buys.)

10) Tone, Microcopy, SEO & Keywords

Voice: confident, slightly snarky, sensual — alternate between gritty noir and intimate confession. Use short punchy lines in CTAs.

SEO keywords: “billionaire romance series,” “enemies to lovers billionaire book,” “romantic suspense Sterling City,” “dark billionaire romance ebooks.” Use keywords in H1, H2, meta description, and first paragraph on book pages.

Meta example: “The Billionaire’s Forbidden Desires — dark, enemies-to-lovers billionaire romance set in Sterling City. Read a free chapter.”

11) UX / Tech Recommendations

Host & CMS: Hostinger (you mentioned it earlier) + WordPress with Elementor or a lightweight React front end if you prefer. Use WooCommerce or Gumroad for direct sales.

Email: ConvertKit or MailerLite (segmented funnels: new subscribers, buyers, VIP).

Analytics: GA4 + heatmaps (Hotjar) to track which excerpt converts best.

Accessibility: readable contrast, skip links, keyboard nav.

12) Monetization & Growth

Primary revenue: book sales (retailer links), direct store (signed ebooks), audiobooks.

Secondary: merch (character wallpapers, bookmarks), Patreon-style VIP, paid book club kits.

Growth: TikTok/YouTube shorts snippets (use your existing channels), Instagram moodboards, and targeted FB/IG ads for lead magnet.

13) Example content snippets (original, safe length & tone)

Email welcome subject: “Welcome to Sterling City — your first forbidden chapter inside.”

Popup microcopy: “Start the series — grab the first chapter + a secret epilogue.”

Footer tagline: “Zoey Appleton — love that bites back.”
